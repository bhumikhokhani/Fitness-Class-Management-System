# Fitness-Class-Management-System

Fitness Class Management System aimed at creating a database system for a fitness centre. The fitness class management system is a Java application that allows the manager the handle all the activities in the fitness center. Interactive GUI and the ability to manage various actions like registrations and payments make this system very flexible and convenient. The Manager has a busy schedule and is unable to manage the entire activities manually on paper. Hence, this system seems more feasible and efficient.<br>
This application enables the power and flexibility to manage the entire system through a single system. The fitness class management project provides event participation records and other necessary. Fitness class management features. Admin has the power to store and update details of its centre’s members and trainers. The system is hence useful for the Manager to portably manage all the records of the fitness centre. <br>
We developed our Fitness Class Management System using the MYSQL database, JAVA as the programming language and NetBeans for the UI. <br>

Our project Fitness Class Management System maintains the entire database of all its trainers and members. The software can be used in all fitness centres to maintain their payments and registration records. While developing this project we learnt a lot about Fitness Centres Management, we have also learnt how to make it user-friendly (easy to use and handle) by hiding the complicated parts from the users. During the development process, we studied more about developing software, and how to implement the backend stored database in the real-time system. We have tried to implement the project making it as user-friendly and error-free as possible. In future, the project can be improved by recording the day-to-day activities taking place in a centre.
